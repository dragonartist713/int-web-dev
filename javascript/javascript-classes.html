	<h1>JavaScript Classes</h1>
	<p>
		These code samples assume that you know a little about OOP (hopefully from your Java class) 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What are <b>classes</b>?</li>
		<li>What purpose do they serve?</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Classes in JavaScript</h2>
	<p>
		Classes did not exist in JavaScript until the most recent major version (ES6).
		Here's an example of a class that represents a bank account (and some code that makes use of the class):
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-js">
	class BankAccount{

		constructor(id, customerName){
			this.id = id;
			this.customerName = customerName;
			this.balance = 0;
		}

		deposit(amount){
			this.balance += amount;
		}

		withdraw(amount){
			this.balance -= amount;
		}

	}

	const acct = new BankAccount(1, "Bob"); // don't forget 'new'
	acct.deposit(50);
	acct.deposit(25);
	acct.withdraw(40);
	acct.withdraw(40);
	console.log(acct.balance);
	acct.balance = 1000000000; // you shouldn't be able to affect balance directly
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		You can add instance variables (also known as properties) to the constructor function (just like we did when we explored constructor functions in JavaScript).
		Notice you can add methods to the class (no need to use the 'function' keyword).
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the balance of a bank account should only be changed by calling
		the deposit() or withdraw() methods.
		But the last line of code shows that the balance property (instance variable) can be directly changed.
	</p>
	<h2>Protecting Instance Variables By Making Them Private</h2>
	<p>
		You can prevent instance variables from being changed from outside the class by making them private.
		To do this, you declare them above the constructor and prefix them with a hash tag (<b>#</b>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Take a look at this version of the BankAccount class:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-js">
	class BankAccount{

		// declare private instance vars (properties) with #
		#balance;

		constructor(id, customerName){
			this.id = id;
			this.customerName = customerName;
			this.#balance = 0; // make sure to add the #
		}

		deposit(amount){
			this.#balance += amount; // make sure to add the #
		}

		withdraw(amount){
			this.#balance -= amount; // make sure to add the #
		}

	}

	const acct = new BankAccount(1, "Bob"); 
	acct.deposit(50);
	acct.deposit(25);
	acct.withdraw(40);
	acct.withdraw(40);
	acct.balance = 1000000000; // Be careful, we just added a balance property to the account, which is not #balance!!!!
	acct.#balance = 1000000000;
	console.log(acct.#balance);
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		The last two lines in this code sample will cause the program to crash, because you cannot access a private instance variable from outside of the class.
	</p>

	<h2>Adding Getters and Setters To Control Access To Private Instance Variables</h2>
	<p>
		You can create special methods (like getters and setters) that allow access to instance variables
		by prefixing them with <b>set</b> or <b>get</b>.
		Take a look at this version of our BanckAccount class:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-js">
	class BankAccount{

		// private properties/instance variables
		#balance;

		constructor(id, customerName){
			this.id = id;
			this.customerName = customerName;
			this.#balance = 0; 
		}

		deposit(amount){
			this.#balance += amount; 
		}

		withdraw(amount){
			this.#balance -= amount; 
		}

		get balance(){
			return this.#balance;
		}

		// set balance(amount){
		// 	this.#balance = amount;
		// }

	}

	const acct = new BankAccount(1, "Bob"); 
	acct.deposit(50);
	acct.deposit(25);
	acct.withdraw(40);
	acct.withdraw(40);
	console.log(acct.balance); // Note that this looks like a property!
	// If we didn't comment out the set balance(){...}
	// we could change the balance like so: acct.balance = 1000000
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Note that in the console.log() it appears that we are accessing a property, but we are actually calling the get method for it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I commented out the set balance method because, as mentioned earlier, we only want to change the balance when a deposit or withdraw occurs.
		But if it were not commented out, we could change the balance like so:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-js">
	acct.balance = 1000000;
	</code></pre>
	<p>
	Note that in .net, getter and setter methods are called properties!
	They look like properties when you use them (no parenthesis) and they allow access to instance variables.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you haven't noticed, it's possible to over draft our bank account.
		Let's fix that by adding some code to withdraw() method:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-js">
	class BankAccount{

		// private properties/instance variables
		#balance;

		constructor(id, customerName){
			this.id = id;
			this.customerName = customerName;
			this.#balance = 0; 
		}

		deposit(amount){
			this.#balance += amount; 
		}

		withdraw(amount){
			if(amount < this.#balance){
				this.#balance -= amount;
			}else{
				// How should we deal with this?
				throw new Error("Overdraft!!!");
			} 
		}

		get balance(){
			return this.#balance;
		}

	}

	const acct = new BankAccount(1, "Bob");
	acct.deposit(50);
	acct.deposit(25);
	acct.withdraw(40);
	//acct.withdraw(40); // This will throw an 'Overdraft!' error
	
	// Q: What should you do if you know a method call could throw and error/exception?
	// A: Wrap it in a try/catch block
	try{
		acct.withdraw(40);
	}catch(e){
		console.log(e.message);
		console.log("We're sorry, but you don't have the funds!");
		// Crash Averted!!!
	}
	</code></pre>
	

	<h2>Extending a Class</h2>
	<p>
		One of the most powerful features of object-oriented programming is that you can extend a class.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the next example, we'll 'extend' the features and functionality of the BankAccount class
		by creating a sub class that allows you to earn interest on your balance!
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-js">
	class InterestBearingAccount extends BankAccount{

		#interestRate;
		#interestEarned;

		constructor(id, name, interestRate){
			super(id, name);
			this.#interestRate = interestRate;
			this.#interestEarned = 0;
		}

		addInterest(){
			const interest = this.balance * this.#interestRate;
			this.deposit(interest);
			this.#interestEarned += interest;
		}

		get interestEarned(){
			return this.#interestEarned;
		}
	}

	const ibAcct = new InterestBearingAccount(1, "Bob", 0.10); // don't forget 'new'
	ibAcct.deposit(50);
	ibAcct.deposit(25);
	ibAcct.withdraw(40);
	ibAcct.addInterest();
	console.log(`BALANCE: ${ibAcct.balance}  INTEREST EARNED: ${ibAcct.interestEarned}`);
	
	console.log(ibAcct); // Note that the prototype is a BankAccount object
	
	// look at what happens when you stringify it
	// (it only includes the non-private instance variables)
	console.log(JSON.stringify(ibAcct));
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Note the <b>extends BankAccount</b> on the first line.
		This means that an InterestBearingBankAccount object has all the features and functionality of a BankAccount, along with a few additional ones.
		In fact, a InterestBearingBankAccount <b>is</b> a BankAccount that allows to earn interest on your savings!
		So we've sub-classed the BankAccount and extended it by adding the features that allow it to add and keep track of interest earnings.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice how the constructor passes the id and customerName up to the super class (the super class is often refered to as the base class).
	</p>
	<p>
		Set a break point on the line that calls the InterestBearingBankAccount constructor, then step into it and notice
		how the code executes.
		Calling <b>super()</b> and passing in the id and customerName params allows the BankAccount class to set the id and customerName params.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that you can't change this.#balance from inside of InterestBearingBankAccount
		because it's private. 
		In other OOP languages you could make an instance variable 'protected'
		which makes it available to sub-classes, but JavaScript does not support protected instance variables at this time.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you console.log the ibAcct variable, you should see that it's prototype is the BankAccount class.
		JavaScript uses what's known as <b>prototypal</b> inheritance rather than <b>classical</b> inheritance (which is used by C# and Java).
		Let's not worry about the difference between the two (but there are plenty of resources out there on the web if you are curiious).
	</p>
	<p>
		Now we'll extend the InterestBearingAccount class and create a sub-class that charges you service fees every time you make a withdraw (BOOOOO!):
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-js">
	class FullServiceBankAccount extends InterestBearingAccount{

		#serviceFeeRate;
		#totalServiceFees;

		constructor(id, name, interestRate, serviceFeeRate){
			super(id, name, interestRate);
			this.#serviceFeeRate = serviceFeeRate;
			this.#totalServiceFees = 0;
		}

		// We are 'overriding' the super class' version of withdraw() (so we can collect a service fee)
		withdraw(amount){
			const serviceFee = amount * this.#serviceFeeRate;
			super.withdraw(amount + serviceFee); // we are calling the super class' version of withdraw()
			this.#totalServiceFees += serviceFee;
		}

		get totalServiceFees(){
			return this.#totalServiceFees;
		}
	}

	const fsAcct = new FullServiceBankAccount(1, "Bob", 0.10, 0.05); 
	fsAcct.deposit(50);
	fsAcct.deposit(25);
	fsAcct.withdraw(40);
	console.log(fsAcct.balance);
	fsAcct.addInterest();
	console.log(`BALANCE: ${fsAcct.balance}`);
	console.log(`INTEREST EARNED: ${fsAcct.interestEarned}`);
	console.log(`TOTAL SERVICE FEES: ${fsAcct.totalServiceFees}`);
	// Set a break point on the call to withdraw() and observe how the code flows into the super class
	// when you hit super.withdraw()
	</code></pre>

	<h2>Calling Super Methods</h2>
	<p>
		You can <b>override</b> a method in a super class and still call it by using <b>super.</b>.
		This allows you to extend methods of the super class (add additional functionality to them).
		In the FullServiceBankAccount class we are overriding the withdraw method because we want to add the service fee
		to the amount of the withdraw.
		Once we adjust the amount, we call the super class' version of withdraw() by prefixing it with <b>super.</b> so that the balance can be adjusted.
		JavaScript will look at the protoype to see if it has a withdraw() method to call.
		If it doesn't find one, it will look at the prototype's prototype.
		It will keep searching up the 'chain' of prototypes until it finds one that includes a withdraw() method
	</p>
	<p>
		Set a break point on the call to withdraw() and observe how the code flows into the super class
		when you step into super.withdraw()	
	</p>	

	<h2>Getting the Specific Type of a Variable</h2>
	<p>
		Finally, here's how you can figure out the exact data type of a variable that stores an object:
	</p>
	<pre><code class="language-js">
	console.log(typeof acct); // This isn't super helpful!
	console.log(acct.constructor.name); 
	console.log(ibAcct.constructor.name); 
	console.log(fsAcct.constructor.name); 		
	</code></pre>
