  						a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\n
						Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, 
						can long endure. 
						We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 
						We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, 
						as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. 
						It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.`;
