<h1>String Methods</h1>
<p>
    First thing to mention should probably be that API stands for Application Programming Interface.  It's code that lets two applications communicate with each other, taking the inputs from a user and delivering them to the system then returning the reply.
    <br>
    I'll be going a little more in-depth with JavaScript specifically and its variety of methods that deal with strings.
</p>
<p>
    The first one we'll look at is string length.  It returns the length of the specified string.  Simple enough.
    <pre>
        <code class="language-js">
            let msg = "four";
            let length = msg.length;
        </code>
    </pre>
    Returning the length variable would give a result of 4, useful for things like password fields that check for numbers of characters.
</p>
<p>
    Next is replace() and it does what it says.  It replaces the the first instance of a specified string with another you provide.
    <pre>
        <code class="language-js">
            let msg = "This page contains HTML, CSS, and HTML."
            let newMsg = msg.replace("HTML", "JavaScript");
        </code>
    </pre>
    The message would thus become "This page contains JavaScript, CSS, and HTML."
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, I'll mention includes().  It searches for strings that include the string it's given
    <pre>
        <code class="language-js">
            const msg = "This string contains words."

            let result = msg.includes("words");
            console.log(result);
        </code>
    </pre>
    The console would display 'true' as the message does contain 'words'.
</p>
