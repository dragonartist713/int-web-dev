				<h1>String Methods</h1>
                <p>
                    First thing to mention should probably be that API stands for Application Programming Interface.  It's code that lets two applications communicate with each other, taking the inputs from a user and delivering them to the system then returning the reply.
                    <br>
                    I'll be going a little more in-depth with JavaScript specifically and its variety of methods that deal with strings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first one we'll look at is string length.  It returns the length of the specified string.  Simple enough.
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
                            let msg = "seven";
                            let length = msg.length;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    Returning the length variable would give a result of 7, useful for things like password fields that check for numbers of characters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next is replace() and it does what it says.  It replaces the the first instance of a specified string with another you provide.
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
                            let msg = "This page contains HTML, CSS, and HTML."
                            let newMsg = msg.replace("HTML", "JavaScript");
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    The message would thus become "This page contains JavaScript, CSS, and HTML."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I'll mention includes().  It searches for strings that include the string it's given
                    <pre>
                        <code class="language-js">
                            const msg = "This string contains words."

                            let result = msg.includes("words");
                            console.log(result);
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    The console would display 'true' as the message does contain 'words'.
                </p>
                <!--Create a blog page that is an instructional article about one of the following 
                    JavaScript APIs: Date methods, -String methods-, DOM methods. 
                    Choose one of these topics and do some research to understand at least three methods. 
                    Then write a web page that explains each of the methods. 
                    In your article you should explain the following (6 pts):
                        What each method does, and when it may be useful.
                        The parameter(s) that can be passed in when invoking each method 
                        (make sure to include the data type of each parameter).
                        What each method returns (make sure to mention the data type)
                        Make sure that your paragraphs are well-well written and that your code 
                        sample display code that is perfectly formatted.
                    Here are the technical requirements for building the page (4 pts):
                        It must use prismJS (or another code syntax highligher) to display at 
                        least 3 code samples
                        It must include atleast one Font Awesome icon
                    The page should have include:
                        a HEADER element at the top of the page which displays the title of your 
                        article in relatively large font
                        An ARTICLE element, which should contain your article and code samples
                        A FOOTER element at the bottom of the page which display the copyright symbol, 
                        the current year, and your first and last name (use relatively small font)
                        The page should look professional (so you'll have to add some CSS code)
                        The page should have breathing room:
                            set the line-height so that the text is easy to read
                            set margin and padding apporpriately
                        Use a font that is easy to read
                        Use colors that make the page easy to read (there should be good contrast between 
                        the font colors and the background colors
                        Set background colors and font colors for the HEADER and FOOTER elements-->
