Here's a really good high-level intro to Git:
	
	https://www.nobledesktop.com/learn/git/what-is-git

If you have never used Git before, the article my be hard to follow,
but I think it's good for students to at least skim it anyway, in order to facilitate discussion

These are the Git commands that you'll need to know:

	git init
	git clone
	git config
	git add
	git commit
	git status
	git log
	git diff
	git push
	git pull
	git branch

You'll also need to understand these concepts:

	readme.md
	.gitinore
	resolving merge conflicts
	undoing changes (revert (for commits), reset (for staged changes), checkout (for unstaged changes)
